#' Removed: fast snap-shift ALS estimator
#'
#' @description
#' \code{lame_snap_als()} fitted a fast point estimate of the snap-shift
#' dynamic latent-factor model. It was removed in lame 1.4.0 and now stops with
#' a message: on simulated snap panels its per-period latent product tracked
#' the generating one less closely than the \code{"ar1"} kind of dynamic ALS
#' (correlation 0.72 against 0.80 on directed panels, 0.24 against 0.67 on
#' bipartite and 0.44 against 0.72 on symmetric ones), and holding its drift at
#' the \code{"ar1"} kind's smoothing, which closed that gap, missed planted
#' resets (both ranked first in 15 of 20 panels against 20 of 20).
#'
#' Fit snap-shift positions with \code{\link{lame}} and
#' \code{dynamic_uv = TRUE, dynamic_uv_kind = "snap"} (the MCMC, directed
#' panels). For bipartite and symmetric panels, or for a point estimate, use
#' \code{dynamic_uv_kind = "ar1"} with \code{method = "als"} or the MCMC.
#'
#' @param ... ignored: every call stops with the message above. A call with
#'   \code{mode = "bipartite"}, \code{R_row} / \code{R_col}, or
#'   \code{symmetric = TRUE} gets the message for that kind of panel.
#' @return Does not return.
#' @seealso \code{\link{lame}}
